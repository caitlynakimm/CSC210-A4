# A7 Linked Lists

Your readme should include the following information. **Each student** needs to submit all of this information, even when pair programming. 

## Submission Details

Your Name: Caitlyn Kim


Programming Partner Name (if you are submitting identical code):


Other Collaborators (submitting related but non-identical code):


Kudos/shout-out to particularly helpful members of the class or teaching staff:
- Shout out to Tabitha from class who helped me think about how to start the mouseClicked() method from Stage 2. Also, shout out to Tania (TA) who helped me check the logic of some of my Stage 2 methods.

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials:


If you used AI, please describe how and the interaction between AI and your understanding of this assignment and specifically the related data structures and algorithms:
- mouseReleased() was complex for me to implement and I had a NoSuchElementException that could occur whenever I released the dragged pile outside of any pile.

## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment?


What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?


What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
- I think I got a better understanding how linked lists can be shrunken/grow bigger and move through iterators and loops.
